  "about": "I have just under a year of working experience as a software engineer at Elementary Robotics where I spent time on the Edge Team. My contributions were centered around advancing the simulated environment within which product testing took place; as well as DevOps-adjacent tasks such as developing scripts that enabled easier and more effective testing sequences and engineering CI/CD pipelines with greater coverage. In essence, I helped allow a more reliable development and delivery of the product to the customer."
