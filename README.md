# Personal Website

My personal website is built using React.js + Bootstrap 5.

# Notes
Need a simpler design...

Don't forget to run

```bash
npm install
```

if you haven't before to reinstall dependencies. If you clone this repository, you should first delete `package-lock.json` and run `npm install` before running

```bash
npm start
```

to launch the web app locally.
